# Student-Information-System
Soft ware Testing project
ABSTRACT:
Student Information System is one of the key factor in academics. It is used to store, administer 
all the aspects of student information like student details, subjects, semester details, 
enrollment details, grades, cgpa of the students. The system which we are going to develop 
allows easy modification of students and other details like payment status, adding exam result 
and generate auto ranking. Student Information system is a system for the education 
establishments to manage the student data. It provides capabilities like tracking students 
attendance, checking the marks, sending sms of results and notices etc.
Information security is a concern, as universities house an array of sensitive personal 
information, making them potentially attractive targets for security breaches, such as those 
experienced by retail corporations or healthcare providers.
The main motive of the project is to test the particular software and getting the awareness about 
that project. How the testing is being done and so on… In our project we are taking the web 
application which is regarding the student information system. And we are suppose to test the 
student information system using the TEST COMPLETE tool. And we will come to know the major 
things in the future. Like how to work with the tool and so many other things.
SCOPE:
The main scope of the project is to test the particular application and getting to know how testing 
is very important. Testing has become crucial for several application/product implementations 
and businesses have begun to realize the importance of structured testing of applications before 
their release.
DESCRIPTION:
Student Information system is a system for the education establishments to manage the student 
data. It helps to manage the information like add student information, admit student in multiple 
programs, student payment system , student attendance system, institute report. Are the 
modules present in this student information system. Here we are going to test this application 
using the test cases and getting all the test cases gets satisfies all the conditions. so that the 
system is working perfectly with no errors.MODULES PRESENT IN THE STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM
• Admin Login 
• Add Student Information
