# Student-Information-System
This is the project of building a Student Management System (SMS) entirely in C++, which is a part of the CS162 university course. We proudly presents a simple but fully-functional, error-free and user-friendly console application to handle operations belonging to the teaching room, such as adding new course, adding/removing students from a course, exporting scoreboards, etc.
